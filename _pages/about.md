Hi, I’m Zhengyu Sun (孙正宇 in Chinese), a first-year M.Eng. student at the [Visualization and Intelligent Data Analytics Lab (VIDA Lab)](https://vida-lab.org/) within Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof. Yong Wang](https://yong-wang.org/). My research interests are about Data Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction.

Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree from the School of Software, Shandong University in Jinan (2025). During that journey, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in Intelligent Media Research Center (iLearn), focusing on low-level vision.

I'm passionate about working alongside outgoing people to create meaningful projects that can improve people's lives. Welcome to discuss interesting ideas, software development, or anything you want with me!

In my spare time, I enjoy walking outdoors and playing badminton. Oh, I really want to learn swimming during my journey in Singapore.
